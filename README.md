3. Setup Instructions
To run this website locally, simply save the provided HTML code into an .html file (e.g., index.html) and open it in any modern web browser.

Steps:

Create a new file named index.html.

Copy and paste the entire HTML code into this file.

Save the file.

Open index.html using your web browser (e.g., by double-clicking the file).

The website is self-contained within this single HTML file, leveraging CDN links for Tailwind CSS and Google Fonts, so no additional installation steps are required.

4. Page Flow
The website navigates as follows:

Home Page (Landing Page) → Click "Explore Our Dreamy Products" or "Start Your Dreamy Journey" → Products Page

Products Page → Click "Product Details" on any product card → Product Details Page (for that specific product)

Product Details Page → Click "Add to Cart" → Checkout Page

Checkout Page → Click "Begin Checkout" → Thank You Page

From Products Page, Product Details Page, or Thank You Page → Click "Back to Home" (or "Back to Products" or "Back to Product") → Returns to the respective previous page or the Landing Page.

5. Technologies Used
HTML5: For the basic structure of the web pages.

CSS (Tailwind CSS CDN): For utility-first styling, enabling responsive and attractive layouts.

JavaScript: For interactive elements and page navigation logic.

Google Fonts (Inter): For a clean and modern typography.

6. Customization
Content:

Update text content (headlines, descriptions) to match your brand's voice.

Replace placeholder images (https://placehold.co/...) with your actual furniture images for a more engaging experience.

Add more product data to the products JavaScript array to expand your catalog.

Styling:

Adjust Tailwind CSS classes directly in the HTML for fine-tuning the look and feel.

Modify the custom CSS within the <style> tags to change button gradients, shadows, or background colors.

Functionality:

The "Add to Cart" and "Begin Checkout" functionality is currently simulated. For a real e-commerce store, you would integrate a backend system, payment gateways, and proper cart management.

You could expand the product details with more attributes (dimensions, materials, reviews, etc.).

Enjoy exploring and customizing your Dreamy Home Furnishings website!
